# VTMToolkit

**VTMToolkit** is a versatile application designed to serve as a standalone character sheet manager inspired on _VtM v5_. With a focus on modular architecture, the project can also be extended and integrated into online RPG platforms, enabling seamless use in virtual tabletop systems. The required effort and necessary adaptations for integration are still to be determined (TBD).

### Project Structure
The project is organized into distinct modules to promote scalability and maintainability:

**Domain:** This layer contains the core models and business logic, encapsulating the core mechanics and rules of _VtM v5_.
